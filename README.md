This project utilizes Text Mining Techniques to recommend Articles Textually, Contextually & based on Topics similarity for the Medical Research using abstracts from the Virtual Health Library database.

## Introduction

The primary purpose is to build a web application platform for article recommendation that will easily help medical researchers to search for articles. The results of the search, either with a keyword or a journal will, allow user to choose from the Articles based on Categorization of Results.

### Models

Following are the three models utilized for this project:

* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Multicore 
* Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
* BERT NLI Senence Transformer

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Multicore

This module allows both LDA model estimation from a training corpus and inference of topic distribution on new, unseen documents. LDA Multicore provides a faster implementation, especially for exceptionally large corpora as in this case. Following is the model representation.
